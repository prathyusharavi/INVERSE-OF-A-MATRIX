# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix.
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner.
## Algorithm:
### Step1 :
to  determine  the inverse of a matrix.
### Step 2:
calculate the determinant (def) of A.
### Step 3: 
calculate the inverse(A^(-1).if det(A) is non-zero,the inverse is given by matrix factorization.
### Step 4: 
if you have a specific matrix you'd like to find the inverse for,feel free to provide it,often involving techinques like a gaussian factorization

## Program:
```
#Program to find the inverse of a matrix.
#Developed by: YENUGANTI PRATHYUSHA
#RegisterNumber:
import numpy as np
a=np.array([[6,2,3],[3,1,1],[10,3,4]])
sol=np.linalg.inv(a)
print(sol)
```
## Output:

## Result:
Thus the inverse of given matrix is successfully solved using python program
